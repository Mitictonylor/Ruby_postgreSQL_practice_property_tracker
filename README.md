Practice on PostgreSQL and RUBY classes

# Property Tracker Lab
Today you’re going to make a table for tracking properties for sale and let.

An entry in the properties table must have a selection of 4 of these properties:

address
value
number of bedrooms
year built
buy/let status
square footage
build (detached, semi-detached, flat, etc)

**Your property class should have:**

- Full CRUD functionality
- The ability to find properties by id
- The ability to find properties by address

**Here’s some steps to follow:**

- Set up your directory structure
- Create console.rb which will be used to create some new objects and practice your methods as required (use this as you are writing the class & methods to test them)
- Create a Ruby file for your Property class
- Write your class definition in the file - initialize, attr_readers, instance variables
- Make the database - createdb in command line
- Make a .sql file and write some SQL to create your database table
- Run the .sql file to set up the table (psql -d database_name -f file_name.sql)
- Implement save, update and delete methods on your class
- Implement a find method that returns one instance of your class when an id is passed in.
- Implement a find_by_address method that returns one instance of your class when a name is passed in, or nil if no instance is found.
